## What is Clip & Ship?
_Clip it and ship it!_

Are you a content creator or editor? Do you hate keeping track of or scouring through 
VODs for notable moments during a broadcast? Are you tired of downloading 
entire VODs to get the footage you want? Then you need Clip & Ship!

Clip & Ship is a standalone application that enables content creators and Twitch streamers
to quickly find specific types of moments during their broadcast by analyzing
emote usage within a VOD. 

## Features

With Clip & Ship you can: 
- Create/Edit/Remove categories based on a streamers Twitch/BTTV/FFZ/other emotes.
  (ex: a "funny" category might include emotes like ![LULW](https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/139407/1), 
  ![OMEGALUL](https://cdn.frankerfacez.com/emoticon/128054/1), 
  ![peepoGiggles](https://cdn.betterttv.net/emote/5e0bcf69031ec77bab473476/1x), etc).
- Process a streamer's VOD to find the best moments for each category.
- View processed moments in the app VOD player and see detailed statistics on emote usage during the moment.
- Download any of the moments found during processing.
- Download other moments by specifying the start & end time.
- Download the whole VOD.
- Export the list of processed moments to a CSV file.

## Why Clip & Ship?

### It's Free
No upfront or subscription costs. Compared to similar services like 
[Highlight Play](https://highlightplay.com/) that have monthly fees, 
Clip & Ship is **the** cost-effective service to use.

### It's Smart
No other service can help you find specific types of moments.

### It's Fast
Instead of going through hours of footage, you can use Clip & Ship and 
have a list of notable moments ready in minutes. With tech from 
[twitch-dl](https://github.com/ihabunek/twitch-dl), downloads are lighting quick.

### It's Efficient
Clip & Ship supports parallel processing, so you can process multiple VODs simultaneously.

### It's Space-Saving
Only download what you need. No need to download a 6-hour long VOD just
to grab 10 minutes of footage.

### It's Open Source
The Clip & Ship source code is publicly available, meaning anyone can
analyze the workflow, verify no malicious code is present, and suggest
improvements to maintain Clip & Ship's integrity and efficiency. 

## Tradeoffs

### Everything's Local
Server costs and cloud storage is expensive, and I didn't receive funding 
for this project to pay for those services. So, Clip & Ship runs entirely 
on your machine and uses up your storage. But, that Clip & Ship is running 
locally is why it is free and open source.

### No Twitch Emote Images
The Twitch API doesn't have an easy way to get streamer emote images. Currently,
I can only download all emotes across the entire site, which is **a lot** of data. Because Clip & Ship
is a standalone app, each distributed copy would have to have this huge amount 
of data. Needless to say, the app size would balloon to a crazy amount. So for now,
you can't see any Twitch emote (but they will be available to use).

### Reliance on APIs and third-party packages
Clip & Ship heavily relies on outside tech to function. The APIs used are
Twitch, BTTV, and FFZ to grab emote data for a channel. If **any** of these
APIs change or fail, Clip & Ship may not work. Similarly, Clip & Ship uses
the [twitch-python](https://github.com/PetterKraabol/Twitch-Python) package 
to grab information about and videos of a channel. If that breaks, so does 
Clip & Ship.

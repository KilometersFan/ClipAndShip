  Clip & Ship is a cutting-edge Twitch VOD analysis program for editors and streamers. Users can set up
  categories of moments for each streamer based on a streamer's emotes (Twitch, BTTV, and FFZ). Then by
  combing through VOD chat messages for emotes, Clip & Ship can find those moments in a broadcast. The
  process is fast, simple, and efficient. Once a VOD is processed, you can view and download any of the
  clips Clip & Ship generates as well as download specific timeframes or even the whole VOD. So you only
  download what you need. Clip & Ship is the future of content creation with Twitch.
